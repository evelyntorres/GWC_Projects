	<h3> Projects in Girls Who Code </h3>
	<p> Now that I have introduced myself, I would like to show you some of the things we have created through Girls Who Code.</p>

	<p> We created the dancing robot with C++ through Arduino. C++ isn't the only language we have used. We have also learned Python and Pygame. We even made this super cool City Sroller with Pygame. <p>
